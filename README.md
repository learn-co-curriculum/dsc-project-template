# Animal Center Needs Analysis
### Alison Peebles Madigan, alison.peeblesmadigan@flatironschool.com

## Business Problem

Austin, Texas is the largest No Kill community in the nation, and home to the Austin Animal Center. They provide shelter to more than 16,000 animals each year and animal protection and pet resource services to all of Austin and Travis County.

The Austin Animal Center _also_ has the longest running public dataset of animal rescues in the country. Every animal has a unique id that ties to both their intake and outcome data when they enter and leave the shelter. Given their data, my questions of interest were:

- What animal needs a PR campaign?
- What resources does the animal shelter need?

### Data
Data can include source and high-level description (e.g. # obs)


## Methods
