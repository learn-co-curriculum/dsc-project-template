# Phase 1 Project Template - Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

![blueprint](images/blueprint.png)

This repository is like a blueprint, providing structure for your first End of Phase Project. We suggest you base your Phase 1 project off of this repository so you can focus less on formatting and organization, and more on the _analysis and communication skills_ that will support your progress through the course. This template is designed to make your project portfolio-ready in order to impress the future employers who will review it.

- Rename the template readme you've been working in by running `git mv TEMPLATE_README.md README.md`
- Delete unnecessary files from the repo using `git rm`

### Notes

- The visualizations in the notebook use best practices for visualization that you should try to emulate. For example, they have clear axes, descriptive titles, and appropriate number formatting
- The `dsc-phase1-project-template.ipynb` is intended to be the _final version_ of your project. The first notebook you create will not look like this. You are encouraged to start with a very disorderly notebook and clean it as you go
