However, despite their eagerness, they lack experience in movie creation. The challenge lies in understanding the current movie landscape and identifying the types of films that perform well at the box office. This project aims to explore these aspects, and its findings will guide the decision-making process for Microsoft's new movie studio, helping to decide what type of films to create.\n",
