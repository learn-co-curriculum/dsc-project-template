The contents of this repository detail an analysis of the module one project. This analysis is detailed in hopes of making the work accessible and replicable.


### Business problem:

Here is where you state the business problem you were trying to solve


### Data
Data can include source and high-level description (e.g. # obs)


## Methods
- descriptive analysis
- choices made
- key relevant findings from exploritory data analysis for mod 1, will be more involved in future mod

## Results
### Here are examples of how to embed images from your sub-folder
#### Visual 1
